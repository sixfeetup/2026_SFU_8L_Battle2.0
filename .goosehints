# Goose Hints: IndyPy 2025 — Battle of the Bots

Project conventions

- Slide authoring style
  - Keep slide bullets ultra‑concise; move detail (lists, dates, links) into presenter notes
  - Lead “What’s New” bullets with bolded category labels (e.g., **v2.0**, **Plugins**, **Hooks**, **MCP**)
  - Maintain consistent style across tools (Aider, Claude Code, Cursor, Goose, Junie, Codex)
  - MCP statements: don’t present MCP as new for Claude Code; note support since 2024 in notes if needed
  
- Presenter notes
  - Always use a Markdown fenced block exactly:
    ::: notes
    - Keep notes concise (≤4 bullets) and actionable
    - Add sources/links here (docs pages, changelogs)
    - Use for speaker-only context, caveats, dates
    :::
  - Place the notes block immediately after the slide it annotates
  
- Formatting
  - Use Markdown; avoid heavy formatting in bullets
  - Use r-fit-text headings as in existing slides

- Git
  - Conventional Commit Message Formatting
  - Commit slide edits with concise messages
